# Ensemble-ML-Model-for-predicting-Diabetes-
In this project, I utilized a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) to predict outcomes using various supervised learning models through the Bagging ensemble technique. The goal was to assess the performance of different models and identify which one proved to be the most accurate for making reliable predictions. In the end, I will present my findings, highlighting the model that demonstrated the highest accuracy and potential for further application in predictive analytics.
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The reason of choosing this data is because, As of the most recent data, India leads the world in the number of people with diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and other global health organizations, India has the highest number of people living with diabetes, with estimates exceeding 74 million cases as of 2021.
